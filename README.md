### 3. ‚ôªÔ∏è Waste Product Classifier Using Transfer Learning
Classifies waste as **organic (O)** or **recyclable (R)** using transfer learning with VGG16 in TensorFlow/Keras.

- **Tech:** TensorFlow/Keras, VGG16, ImageDataGenerator
- **Highlights:**
  - Transfer learning with feature extraction and fine-tuning
  - Real-time image augmentation
  - Accuracy/loss curves across epochs
  - Test predictions with annotated visual output
- **Results:** Fine-tuned model achieved higher validation accuracy than feature extraction
